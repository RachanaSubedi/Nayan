## Problem Statement
Eye is one of the most valuable body organs. It’s essential to take good care of eye from early age. One of the leading causes of eye damage is ill usage of smart phones. Children are more prone to ill usage of mobile phone devices. They stare at screen form very short distance and continue staring for hours. Glare at screen for a longer time span can further strain the eyes. Children who experience eye fatigue may experience headaches, eye pain, or simply feel fatigued. Similarly, children even forget to blink their eyes. Over use of mobile phone by young children can cause myopia or short sightedness. Focusing on near object for longer period of time causes eye ball to elongate. It also leads to the problem of lazy eye and cataract. It has been one of the global problems affecting around 80 million children. In today's busy world parents often leave their children with mobile phones as they are busy with their work and have less time to take care of them. So, children get more time to be engaged with the phone without their parent’s surveillance.

Children keep screen too close to their eyes while using mobile phone. Likewise, they blink for less number of times than normal. This leads to various eye problems like **myopia,** **lazy eye,** **cataract**

## Our Solution
Our project NAYAN has been precisely build to solve this specific problem. NAYAN is a smartphone inbuild mode. Children can easily install this mode in their smartphone and develop a healthy mobile usage habit. Our project is not just confined to children. Even adults can use this mode as other age groups are also facing this problem. Parents can install this mode in their child’s phone and control their ill usage habit. Our app thoroughly scans the blink rate, distance between eye and screen and various possible diseases. If the blink rate and distance between the eye and the screen are at extreme levels, it will warn the user. In this way, user will be alert about ill usage habit and protects their eye from possible damages.

## PROTOTYPE LINK:
**https://bit.ly/3BLNPk0**
To see the demo of our prototype you will have to have python 3 or higher version installed in your computer.Now, you have to download this folder from the Github or the drive link. Then open cmd terminal in path where main.py is present.
Now you have to create a virtual environment where all the python libraries will be installed and the required libraries are kept inside the requirements.txt file
the code for the cmd are kept in scripts.txt
copy all of it and paste it in the cmd terminal but make sure you are in the same path where main.py is present

After the libraries are installed use python main.py to run the prototype



If the distance between your eye and screen is less than 22 cm, you'll receive warning.

If the number of blinkings per minute is less than x, you'll receive warning.
